					<div class="modal-body">
						<p>The effectiveness of Acupuncture in the treatment of specific complaints is dependent on a number of factors; the severity of the problem, how long the problem has persisted before seeking acupuncture treatment, and perhaps most importantly, the overall constitutional health of the patient before the problem occurred.  Additional ongoing factors would most certainly include lifestyle, including diet, rest, exercise and stress.</p>
						<p>Many medical practitioners refrain from using the word "cure".  Western medical doctors, for example, usually talk about a "remission".  Cure suggests a static condition.  Take a very simple example: the majority of broken bones heal with no problems and so could be said to be cured; however, if the person sustained exactly the same accident again they could have a reoccurrence of the same injury.  Similarly every illness arises for a reason; any complaint could reoccur if the causes that produced it in the first place are repeated.</p>
						<p>Very acute complaints particularly the everyday kind of colds and flu's get better even without treatment of any kind, these are known as self-limiting complaints.  Similarly if we cut ourselves or break a bone these heal with little more than supportive measures such as stitches or splints at the most. Acupuncture can assist this normal healing and recovery.  Even more serious complaints sometimes surprise people by spontaneously clearing up.</p>
						<p>It is a basic belief in wholistic health care that health is the natural state and the bodymind is a self-maintaining and self-healing mechanism, always striving toward re-creating the natural state of balance.   Classical Acupuncture has as its goal to eliminate the obstacles preventing the body-mind from achieving this natural state of balance.  When symptoms occur, it is a "red flag" indicating the balance has been compromised.  Rather than simply palliate the symptom, which essentially would eliminate the body's danger signal mechanism, Acupuncture addresses both the cause of the problem and its symptomatic manifestation.  As long as balance is maintained, the potential to remain symptom-free is maximized.</p>

					<div class="modal-body">
						<p>The answer to this question can be understood in relation to the type of conditon. Generally speaking, the more acute the condition, the more frequently treatment is required, until the acute stage is abated. In practice patients do not often go to acupuncturist for purely acute complaints.</p>
						<p><b>Acute:</b> A sudden infection or injury in someone of previously good health. Divided into two categories:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>An acute conditon or an everyday injury of a self-limiting nature does not need such intensive treatment.</li>
							<li>A more severe conditon of an acute and severe type. Frequent, closely spaced treatment is indicated. This might mean, depending on circumstances, every day, or 2 or 3 times per week until the severity of the condition reduces.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><b>Chronic:</b> May be divided into two main types.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>An ailment that is long standing</li>
							<li>May be relatively recent but is clearly persistent; i.e. not getting better in the usual expected time period for such an ailment. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>Generally speaking treatment that aims to help the body heal itself is done less frequently than for acute complaints, but over alonger period of time. Typically once per week until the symptoms begin to clear and then treatments are gradually spaced further and further apart.</p>

					<div class="modal-body">
						<p>Generally speaking, most patients begin receiving treatment once per week for at least the first five or six sessions.  Then, as the person begins to feel generally better, and improvement becomes obvious to the practitioner through diagnostic tools such as color and odor observation and pulse diagnosis, the sessions may be gradually spaced further and further apart.  It is the purpose of Classical Acupuncture treatment to intervene less and less in order to allow the patient's body-mind to achieve balance on its own.  Ultimately, the goal is a partnership between the patient and the practitioner, wherein the patient is able to maintain balance in their own lives through proper nutrition, exercise, and rest; and the practitioner is available for seasonal "tune-ups" or for occasional treatments should life intervene and the patient be knocked out of balance through external circumstances.  (For example, the holidays might bring late nights and overindulgence which weakens the constitutional health and makes one more vulnerable to viruses and injury).</p>
						<p>Having said this, long-standing chronic complaints can require a longer period of treatment.  There is a "rule of thumb" in the tradition of wholistic healing that a month of treatment is generally needed for every year of an illness.  This is very inexact and there is wide individual variation but it does give some idea of average expectations.</p>

					<div class="modal-body">
						<p>It is not uncommon for people to use Acupuncture as preventive health care.  However, provided one leads a balanced life style, it is certainly possible to maintain one's health and well-being for very long periods of time, providing external circumstances do not prove too taxing.  In fact, many practitioners consider optimum health to be defined by how well we recover from occasional illness, rather than whether or not we actually avoid illness at all.  For this reason, we encourage patients to follow the usual recommended course of treatment with gradual spacing in order to assure that the body-mind is able to gain strength and independence step by step. Then we are available for support when circumstances strain one's ability to maintain the balance needed to stay healthy.  Certainly we recommend a tune up at the change of seasons, when the body is having to make a major homeostatic climatic adjustment. </p>

			        	<h5>Definition</h5>
			        	<p>Acupuncture is one of the most ancient and complex tools used by practitioners of Classical Chinese medicine. It is a system of therapy (including, but not limited to, the relief of pain) which has been in constant use throughout Chinese cultural areas of the world for at least 3,500 years. It is based on ancient texts and oral tradition developed over 2 millenia of continuous clinical observation and critical thinking. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine needles at varying depths in specific acupuncture points throughout the body, with the purpose of re-establishing a "state of health" within the individual. The particular points used in each treatment are chosen according to various diagnostic factors unique to Chinese Medicine, and are aimed toward helping to establish a harmonious relationship between all systems on a physical, mental and emotional level.</p>
			        	<hr class="my-4">
			        	<h5>Philosophical Background</h5>
			        	<p>The human organism, in Chinese medical thought, is considered a microcosm of the external environment. Just as nature relies on balance and the natural rhythms of such things as seasonal change, so also does our health depend upon the harmonious relationship of all of our bodily systems and our emotional balance and sense of well-being. Relationships with our individual as well as natural external environment, (such as food ingested, quality of the air we breathe, living situation, relationships, work habits, exercise, general lifestyle, quality of life, etc.), is also considered crucial in maintaining health. The two main concepts upon which Chinese medicine is based are that of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements (Wu Xing).</p>
			        	<p>The concept of <b>Yin/Yang</b> represents the fundamental duality in the universe, which, because it is in constant movement, represents complementary characteristics, ever changing into each other to create unity. Both are necessary for the whole to exist. The relationship represents relativity, since one is only defined in relation to the other. For example, Yin represents stasis, movement inward, heaviness. Yang represents movement outward, lightness, clear action. All of these terms are only relevant in relation to its point of contrast. What is light in one situation, may be heavy in another.</p>
			        </div>
			        <div class="col-sm-2"></div>
			      </div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-sm-1"></div>
							<div class="col-sm-9">
			        	<p><b>The Five Element Theory</b> represents constant movement and change of everything in nature, including the human organism. They symbolize five different inherent qualities and states of natural phenomena. The five elements are: wood, fire, earth, metal and water. Each organ system is related to one of the elements, and these relationships define cycles and directions of energetic movement. Thus we know that energy flows from the lung (metal) to the kidney (water) thence to the liver (wood), and so on. There is also established a controlling cycle. For example, the heart (fire) controls the lungs (metal)--hence distress with the heart is often accompanied by breathing difficulty.</p>
			        	<p>Chinese Herbal medicine is also based upon Yin/Yang and Five Element Theory and it has had its own line of development that at times has paralleled that of acupuncture and at other times has been quite divergent.</p>
			        	<p><b>"Qi"</b> is a Chinese word virtually untranslatable in English, but which roughly corresponds to our idea of energy or vital life force. Qi flows throughout the body by way of specific pathways (measurable electronically) called Meridians. There are 12 main Meridians which pathways correspond in location and function with 10 organ systems and 2 functions (The Pericardium and Triple Burner). When the Qi flows smoothly and evenly throughout the body, there is health and well-being. When there is stagnation, obstruction or depletion of Qi in any one area there is a domino effect which will eventually cause other symptoms to occur. Treating symptoms in isolation will not necessarily effect a cure, since the underlying energetic cause of the problem may lie in areas other than where the symptom occurred. Therefore, an understanding of function and relationship are crucial aspects of effective acupuncture treatment.</p>
			        	<hr class="my-4">
			        	<h5>East and West--a difference in perspective</h5>
			        	<p>In the Western medical paradigm, we are trained to place emphasis on body structure and how it changes during the course of disease. Disease is generally thought of as being due to causes which can be killed, cut out, or contained. In addition, there is a tendency toward compartmentalization and isolation of individual parts. There is a search for underlying mechanisms, a cause which is well-defined, self-contained phenomenon, thus creating a quantifiable description in a narrow area.</p>
			        	<p>To the Classically trained acupuncturist, the emphasis is almost entirely on function and relationship. Attention is directed toward the complete physiological and psychological individual and all relevant information, including but not limited to symptoms, is woven together into a diagnosis reflecting patterns of disharmony and constitutional weakness. This synthesis helps form a picture of the individual person as a whole and helps to identify the "imbalance". Treatment proceeds toward recreating "balance", thus building that persons overall strength and vitality. Health is re-established through the body's own ability to heal itself, once obstruction has been removed.</p>
			        	<hr class="my-4">
			        	<h5>Diagnosis</h5>
			        	<p>There are various classical Acupuncture traditions which have specific areas of emphasis in diagnosis. The primary tools used by most traditions include palpating 12 energy pulses (6 on each wrist) which each correspond to one of the 12 main Meridian systems. The tongue is observed for tissue vitality, color, coating, etc. Complexion, sound of voice, odor, emotional response, body posture, flesh and muscle tone, condition of hair and fingernails, areas of sensitivity on palpation, body temperature variations--all of these factors and more are related to a complex system of correspondences which then help to form a working diagnosis of the imbalance.</p>
			        	<hr class="my-4">
			        	<h5>History</h5>
			        	<p>There is evidence to support that Acupuncture had its origins in Neolithic times, at least prior to 1,000 BC and some archeological findings which support a date as early as 3,500 BC. In 1929, relics were excavated in Korea which included stone and bone acupuncture needles. In 1963 Chinese archeologists found stone needles at a Neolithic site in Inner Mongolia which they estimate to be between 4 and 10,000 years old. Metal needles have been used at least since 800 BC.</p>
			        	<p>The birth of classical texts on acupuncture and herbal medicine occurred during the Warring States period in China (403-221 BC - Zhou dynasty). The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine or the Nei Jing, contains voluminous theoretical and practical information on all the different aspects of traditional Oriental medicine. It consists of two parts, Su Wen (Simple Questions) and Ling Shu (Spiritual Pivot) of 81 chapters each. Prior to the writing of the texts, the art was passed along by time honored oral tradition, from master to student.</p>
			        	<hr class="my-4">
			        	<h5>Choosing an Acupuncturist</h5>
			        	<p>Because of the differences in approach and applied theory between Western medicine and Classical Acupuncture, a thorough knowledge of Western medicine is not necessarily helpful in learning Classical Chinese medicine. While undergraduate College Pre-medical sciences are required by both Western medical schools and Acupuncture Schools, the graduate training then becomes very divergent. Most accredited or approved Acupuncture Colleges are 3-year, full-time programs which involve intensive study of didactic and practical Chinese medical theory, acupuncture anatomy and physiology in relation to precise point location, physical diagnostic evaluation, and supervised clinical practice. After successfully completing some 2,500 hours of training and obtaining a graduate degree in acupuncture, most states require practitioners to pass the competency examination administered by the National Commission for the Certification of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, to be eligible for licensing. Given the vast amount of material to be mastered, as well as the challenge involved in learning an art which relies so heavily on one's personal development of touch sensitivity, observational skills and basic ability to develop rapport with one's patients, successful licensure is considered entry level in the field, and most licensed practitioners continue their training throughout their careers.</p>
			        	<p>The quality and length of training is important in terms of receiving the benefit of Classical Acupuncture. Before choosing an acupuncturist, it would be adviseable to ask where they were trained, the length of the program and/or whether they have passed the national competency examination (NCCAOM). Licensure in most states will ensure at least entry level training, however Acupuncture licensure has no jurisdiction, in many states, over other medical professions which may choose to include acupuncture under their umbrella of practice.</p>
